That's an excellent question, and it points to a common area of confusion. While Next.js has its own powerful server and routing system, it can also be used with a custom Node.js server, which is very often an Express server.

The error you're seeing strongly suggests that your Next.js application is being run through a custom Express server.

## The Connection Between Next.js and Express
Next.js's Built-in Server: By default, when you run next dev or next start, you're using Next.js's own optimized server. It handles page rendering, API routes, and static file serving automatically.

Custom Server for More Control: Sometimes, developers need more control than the default server offers (e.g., for custom server-side logic, websockets, or integrating with an existing backend). In this case, they create a file like server.ts or server.js at the root of the project, install Express, and use it to handle incoming requests before passing them off to Next.js to render the pages.

Your package.json script provides the biggest clue:

JSON

"dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts"
This script is not running the standard next dev command. Instead, it's using tsx (a tool to run TypeScript files) to execute server/index.ts. This server/index.ts file is almost certainly where an Express server is defined.

## How to Fix It in Your Next.js App
You need to find the problematic route definition inside your custom Express server file.

Open the file server/index.ts. This is the entry point for your application as defined in your dev script.

Look for route definitions. Inside that file, you will find code that looks like app.get(...), app.post(...), or router.use(...).

Find the typo. Just like in the previous answer, you are looking for a route path that has a colon (:) without a name following it.

Example of what to look for in server/index.ts:

TypeScript

// server/index.ts

import express from 'express';
import next from 'next';

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
const app = next({ dev });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(() => {
  const server = express();

  // Look for the error in these route definitions
  server.get('/api/posts/:', (req, res) => { // <--- THIS IS THE LIKELY ERROR
    // ... your logic
  });
  
  // This is a correct route
  server.get('/api/posts/:postId', (req, res) => {
    // ... your logic
  });

  // This handles all other requests and passes them to Next.js
  server.all('*', (req, res) => {
    return handle(req, res);
  });

  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('> Ready on http://localhost:3000');
  });
});
In short: your project is a Next.js application, but it's being served and managed by a custom Express server defined in server/index.ts. The error is in the Express part of your code, not the Next.js part.
